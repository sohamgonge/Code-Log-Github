                Haw had now left his past way behind, Haw had now taken big steps and felt stronger than before. He felt as if his journey would never end. But this wasn't ture soon he search came to an end, he went through a corridor, which he had seen never before, when he visited the corridor he found a new cheese station, Station N, Station N was full of cheese, it was overflowing with cheese, It was beyond his Dreams, here were all types of cheese bright and tasty, at the same he discovered that his friends sniff and scurry were also present there, sniff noded his head and scurry waved towars him. He said hello to both of them and sat down with them for eating cheese, Haw climbed the top of cheese, he tasted all types of cheese he could find he removed his shoes. Excited Haw was running from this end to another, he was screaming with happiness, Hurray! For Change. Sniff and Scurry were very happy seeing him Haw took a big piece and ate while saying Hurray!Hurray!
            </p>
            <p class="parainden">
                Haw discovered that the fastest way to cheeese was to laugh at your own mistakes, laugh out loud very loud. Haw had changed his meathods and as we saw he got cheese. Haw also got to learned a lot from sniff and scurry, a life of a mouse is very simple they don't complicate things as humans do, when they feel that cheese is over then they act over it immediately. They move with the cheese, and Haw will remember it permanently. Soon the thought of Hem striked his mind, he thought how about helping Hem a bit, but he remembered that he had already did Hem now had to find his own way here. Hem now needs to make things work out himself, because no one else can help it now, unless and until he don't want no one can, If only Hem had come out of Station C, and read those walls on which Haw Wrote about his experiences, be it a new learning or a new concept whatever it may be.
            </p>
            <p class="parainden">
                So Haw remembered those learnings and decided to summarise them on the largest wall. He then wrote it down there and took a big piece of cheese, it was when it heard a sound, sound of steps, maybe it was Hem, maybe now all four friends could move with the cheese and enjoy it.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                So the crux or the conclusion of the story is that you learned about effective ways of adopting change, because this cheese will keep on moving, but you will have you move along with cheese. Sometimes you might feel like Hem who resists change, you might be be afraid of change because you are afraid of losing something or maybe you might value something a lot this may be the reason you feel frustrated and angry, maybe you are afraid of future, but instead of thinking of something negative think of something positive, because negative thoughts will force you to negative action. That is why be like Haw it will help you find new cheese, because new cheese will always be there, it's now upto you to find it and taste it. As it's been said, when you think about the worst then there is nothing worse than that, infact it never turns out that bad, that's why think about such situation and take action.
            </p>
            <p class="parainden">
                With this summary ends here. But tell us your opinon on the 4 characteres, when do you think you were Hem when were You Ham or sometimes sniff or maybe scurry. Whatever you found relatable, where you stopped when did you found yourself wandering everything you can share to us by writing in the comment box also send us what's the next summary you are wanting. And you can keep sharing your love by sharing this summary with anyone who you think might need it. Till the next meet keep learning and goodbye.
