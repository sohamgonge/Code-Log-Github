            <p class="para">
                Haw was again lost into his fantasy, in his imagination were his favorite 5 different types of cheese the more he thought about more real it felt, it felt as if he is eating cheese. He then wrote:
            </p>
            <p class="parainden"><i>Imagine Yourself Enjoying Your New Cheese Leads You To It.</i></p>
            <p class="parainden">
                Haw was earlier Pessimistic, now he had become Optimistic, He now felt that he was uselessly afraid of change, infact change is very important in life for improvement. "Why didn't got this idea earlier?" Haw talked to himself. Haw then ran into the maze, he was feeling strong and motivated. While running he found a new cheese station, along whose door were a few pieces of cheese, this was a new type of cheese which Haw had never known before, he ate some more cheese and stored some in his pocket, then he opened the station door. He was very excited but the station was empty maybe someone had already stolen away the cheese already. Now he had to more even more quickly who knows he could find some more cheese at some other station. Haw picked up some more pieces, he wanted to give them to Hem maybe he might have changed his mind Haw thought and started to move towards station C, but before leaving he wrote on the wall:
            </p>
            <p class="parainden"><i>"The Quicker You Let Go Of Old Cheese, The Sooner You Find New Cheese."</i></p>
            <p class="para">
                Haw reached Station C and where Hem was, he took a piece of cheese and offered it to Hem, Hem felt good but refused to take the new cheese, Hem said,"I don't like the new cheese, I won't eat this new cheese, I want the same old cheese." Haw was very disappointed and returned to the empty cheese station. He was missing his friend a lot but didn't wanted to leave the adventure. The happiness Haw got after getting rid of his fear was a happiness he ever achieved, Today's Haw was completely different from the Cheese Station C Haw. And he was confident that he will one day get the Cheese, He again wrote on the wall,
            </p>
            <p class="parainden"><i>"It Is Safer To Search In The Maze, Than Remain In A Cheeseless Situation."</i></p>
            <p class="para">
                Haw now understood that Change is unavoidable, Haw remembered the old day when he felt scared and hopeless, days when it felt like everything in life was going wrong, everything, especially with him. But Haw had now learned to adopt and he wrote on the wall:
            </p>
            <p class="parainden"><i>"Old Beliefs Do Not Lead You To New Cheese."</i></p>
            <p class="para">
                Since Haw Changed his beliefs, his behavior changed too. It's upto you, You can believe that a change will harm you and resist it. Or you can believe that finding New Cheese will help you and embrace the change. It Depends on what you choose to believe. It's completly under your control it's not that difficult, With this Haw wrote some notes on the wall:
            </p>
            <p class="parainden"><i>When You See That You Can Find And Enjoy New Cheese, You Change Course,</i></p>
            <p class="para">
                "Which means when you know that you can find new cheese than you can improve your life, then he wrote:"
            </p>
            <p class="parainden">
                <i>
                    "Noticing Small Changes Early Helps You Adapt To The bigger Chagnes That Are To Come."
                </i>
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                Which means if you start noticing the small changes then you can easily adopt the big changes that are yet to come.
