            </div>
            <p>
                Let's learn first what procrastination is and what is not, using the example
                of
                Maria, a working mother who consistently finds herself unable to complete tasks by the end of the day,
                leading her to label herself a procrastinator. Despite careful planning, factors such as her children's
                illnesses, daycare changes, and her and her husband's work-related travel frequently disrupt her plans
                and
                cause delays in completing tasks like putting away laundry or sorting files in her office. She feels
                overwhelmed and unsure of how to manage her responsibilities with so many unpredictable events affecting
                her
                daily routine.
            </p>
            <div class="subhead">Issue</div>
            <p>
                Examples in Maria's life should not be seen as procrastination because delay is a part of making
                priorities,
                and a child's illness is more important than anything we planned for that day. The key issue here is
                that it
                is not a voluntary delay.</p>
            <p>
                Voluntary delay:-Tasks that are intentionally delayed without any specific external reason or constraint
                are
                considered voluntary delays.</p>
            <p>
                Let's See what exactly Is Procastination according to this book:"Procrastination is voluntary delay of
                an
                intednded action despite the knowledge that this delay may harm the indivisdual in terms of the task
                performance of even just how the individual feels about the task or him- or herself." in short
                Procastination is a needless voluntary delay.
            </p>
            <p>
                Delay is an important part of life at any given moment we have numerous things to do but what we will
                select
                to do is based on our intentions, goals/tasks for the day, and majorly on our choice during such cases
                we
                should ask ourselves questions like. What is the most important now? What is the most wise thing you can
                do
                given your goals, responsibilities, roles and desires?
            </p>
            <p>
                Procastination, is completely opposite to other types of delay, it is a intended delay of a voluntary
                task,
                a task we know if not done right now may even harm us in the future. There is nothing prventing us from
                doing the task except our reluctance to act. Isn't is confusing why are we reluctant to act? Why is it
                we
                become our own worst enemy?
            </p>
            <p>
                To understand our own reluctant act towards a task which is in our best intrest. Therefore, we need to
                have
                strategies to overcome this reluctance. because Procrastination is not one time thing it is a habit, and
                habits are action that we do without thinking so to come over this we have to consiously work on it. In
                fact, cross-cultural research by Joseph Ferrari at DePaul University (Chicago) has demonstrated that for
                as
                much as 20% of the population, this procrastination habit is chronic and ffect many parts of our lives.
                Which Means For about 20% of people, procrastination isn't just an occasional bad habit; it's more like
                a
                persistent issue that affects many parts of their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later in this Summary we will see how predecisions will help us to counter this habit that you are
                afraid
                of, which is largely based on the work of Peter Gollwitzer(New Yourk University). Using predecisions
                which would help ourselves do what we want to do at a particular time and reduce the potential
                distractions and how
                to cope more effectively with setbacks and disappointments as we work towards changing our behavior.
            </p>

                STRATEGIES TO CHANGE
            </div>
            <p>
                In this strategy i want you to categorize delays in your mind on basis of which are procrastination and
                which aren't while going through this process you will come to know which delays are truly voluntary
                that
                reduces your perofrmance also you will see a pattern emerging something in common. For example, you may
                find
                that these tasks, progects, or intended actions show some common feelings by knowing this difference
                will be
                a good place to start.
            </p>
            <p>
                As per the following table catogerize your tasks, projects, activites, or "things" in your life on which
                you
                tend to procrastinate. Next to each, jot down what emotions and thoughts come to mind when you think of
                each
                of these moments of procrastination. Make sure you don't ovethink during this task just do this quickly
                because when we don't we overthink.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly. When you are finished with your list, look for patterns in the emotions or thoughts involved.
                You will
                want to refer back to these when reading some chapters that follow.</p>
