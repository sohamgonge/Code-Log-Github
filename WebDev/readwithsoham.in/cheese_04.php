                Haw was now feeling a change in his life, he smiled at himself and said, "Better late than never" For the next few days Haw wandered in the maze and found a little bit cheese. Many times Haw used to get confused in the maze but, he never gave up. For Haw coming out of his comfort zone and searching for cheese was not less than an challenge, but thought it wasn't that bad. Whenever he felt bad, Haw used to think that his current situation is better than a completely cheeseless situation he had when Haw was in Station C. Haw thought that instead of waiting for cheese it's better to seach for it. Haw now at this moment felt that he has a control over his life, now he had decided that he would now won't let anything shake him.
            </p>
            <p class="parainden">
                Haw now felt that if sniff and scurry can do this then why can't he. Haw now also felt that the pile of cheese might not have vanished overnight, the reduction in the pile and the change in taste due to expiring of the cheese could have been an sign which Haw could have noticed but he had ignored it. If he hadn't ignored then he might haven't be in the situation he is now Haw might have been prepared and not gotten this shocked. Haw now decided that when next time such situaiton arises he will quickly adopt the changes.
            </p>
            <p class="parainden">
                Haw stopped a while for some rest and wrote on the wall.
            </p>
            <p class="parainden"><i>"Smell The Cheese Often So You Know When It Is Getting Old."</i></p>
            <p class="para">
                Haw then continued his journey and found a station which was as big was staion C, from outside it looked pretty good maybe there was enough cheese inside, but when he entered the station there was nothing there. Haw was very disappointed, he thought that he should return to station C at least there was Hem to accompany him. "What will happen will I wall down will I never find the path, will I forget the way back, will I never get cheese." Haw was now getting negative thoughts, but he asked himself a question what would he have done if he wasn't scared. Soon he realised that it is his fear due to which the mission is getting worse he cannot give up now at any costs. Haw now wrote on the wall,
            </p>
            <p class="parainden"><i>"Movement In A New Directions Helps You Find New Cheese."</i></p>
            <p class="parainden">
                Haw laughed loudly and said whatever comes now will be taken care off. He was now feeling good, he wondered. "I don't have any Cheese and I don't know where I am going." He stopped to write again on the wall: It read,
            </p>
            <p class="parainden"><i>"When You Stop Being Afraid, You Feel Good."</i></p>
            <p class="para">
                He was worried for nothing good. Now that is not afraid he is feeling far better and able to see a new life ahead, a new direction to move on.
